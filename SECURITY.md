# Security Policy ðŸ”’

I take security seriously at **README Generator**. This document outlines how I handle security issues in the project and how you can report security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **README Generator**, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not create a public issue** on GitHub.
   - I recommend that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been resolved, to prevent exploitation by malicious users.

2. **Email us directly** at [m.eshanized@gmail.com](mailto:m.eshanized@gmail.com).  
   This is our dedicated security email address for vulnerability reports. Please provide as much detail as possible, including:
   - A description of the issue
   - The steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages

3. **I will review the report** and acknowledge receipt within 72 hours. Our team will investigate the issue and work on a fix.

## What Happens Next?

- **Initial Response**: After receiving your report, I will acknowledge it within 72 hours and begin assessing the severity of the issue.
  
- **Fix & Mitigation**: I will prioritize the vulnerability based on severity, and work to patch it as quickly as possible. I will also take steps to mitigate the issue in the meantime if required.

- **Disclosure**: Once the vulnerability has been resolved, I will disclose the details of the fix in a GitHub release note or on the relevant issue. I will always provide credit to the person who reported the issue, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates

I aim to maintain a secure repository and regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities. 

- Security patches will be applied as soon as possible after the vulnerability is discovered.
- If a dependency has a known vulnerability, I will update to a secure version in a timely manner.
  
I will regularly publish releases to keep **README Generator** up to date with security fixes.

## Responsible Disclosure

I follow a responsible disclosure policy. I ask that security researchers provide us with a reasonable amount of time to fix vulnerabilities before publicly disclosing them. This helps protect the community and users from potential threats.

## Security Best Practices

- I encourage contributors to follow security best practices when submitting code or creating pull requests.
- Always validate user input to prevent injection attacks.
- Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords or API keys in public repositories or logs.

Thank you for helping make **README Generator** more secure! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out via the security email.

This policy is designed to ensure clear and responsible communication when security issues arise. It outlines the steps for reporting vulnerabilities, the process for addressing them, and how I maintain a secure environment for the project.
